# HeartcodeHeroes

The project  Heartcodeheroes  is the one that we built for Jayadeva Hospital in one of the hackathon that i have participated.

# About the Project:
This project is based in digital transcription. Imagine a situation where there are huge number of patients in the hospital and the doctors are finding an issue writing the description and explainig it to the patients which consume more time and are not able to look after all the patients. our poject solves this major problem with the digital transsription where the doctor dictates the prescription to our model and it converts the voice to text using windows speech recognition which has 98% accuracy . we use gemini API to solve the complexity of the words used by the doctors which again uses biobert and medicalbert dataset that is available in kaggle for the better responses.
we have also included the language translation where we have included almost all the indian languages and by one click the text will be translated into whichever language the user wants.


We have used HTML , CSS , JS for the frontend and functionality . And also flask to handle the backend functionality.
